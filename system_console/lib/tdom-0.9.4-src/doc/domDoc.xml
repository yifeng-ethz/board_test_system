    <title>DESCRIPTION </title>

    <p>This command manipulates one particular instance of a document
object. <m>method</m> indicates a specific method of the document class. These
methods should closely conform to the W3C recommendation "Document Object Model
(Core) Level 1" (<ref
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/level-one-core.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/level-one-core.html</ref>). Look
at these documents for a deeper understanding of the functionality.</p>

      <p>The valid methods are:</p>

        <desc><p>Returns the DOM tree as an (optional indented) XML
        string or sends the output directly to the given
        channelId.</p>

        <p>The -indent option requires "no", "none", "tabs" or a
        natural number betwenn 0 and 8, both included, as value. With
        the values "no" or "none" no additional white space outside of
        markup will be added to the serialization. I. Otherwise, it's
        a "pretty-print" serialization, due to inserting white space
        between end and the next start tag according to the nesting
        level. The level indentation wide is given with the number. If
        the value is "tabs", then indentation is done with tabs, one
        tab per level.</p>
        
        <p>If the option <m>-escapeNonASCII</m> is given,
        every non 7 bit ASCII character in attribute values or element
        PCDATA content will be escaped as character reference in
        decimal representation.</p>

        <p>The flag <m>-doctypeDeclaration</m> determines whether
        there will be a DOCTYPE declaration emitted before the first
        node of the document. The default is not to emit it. The
        DOCTYPE name will always be the element name of the document
        element. An external entity declaration of the external subset
        is only emitted if the document has a system identifier.</p>

        <p>The flag <m>-xmlDeclaration</m> determines whether there
        will be an XML Declaration and a newline emitted before
        anything else. The default is not to emit one. If this flag is
        given with a true argument then</p>

        <p><m>-encString</m> sets the encoding value in the XML
        Declaration. Otherwise this option is ignored. Please note
        that this option just enhances the string representation of the
        generated XML Declaration with an encoding information string,
        nothing more. It's up to the user to handle encoding in case
        of writing to a channel or reparsing.</p>
            
        <p>If the option <m>-escapeAllQuot</m> is given,
        quotation marks will be escaped with &amp;quot; even in text
        content of elements.</p>

        <p>If the option <m>-indentAttrs</m> is
        given, then attributes will each be separated with newlines
        and indented to the same level as the parent node plus the
        value given as argument to <m>-indentAttrs</m> (0..8).</p>

        <p>If the option <m>-nogtescape</m> is given then the
        character '>' won't get escaped in attribute values and text
        content of elements. The default is to escape this
        character.</p>

        <p>If the option <m>-noEmptyElementTag</m> is given then no
        empty tag syntax will be used. Instead, if an element has
        empty content it will be serialized with an element start tag
        and an immediately following element end tag.</p>

        <p>If the option <m>-escapeCR</m> is given then the character
        '\r' will be escaped as character reference in attribute
        values and text content of elements. The default is to not do
        this.</p>

        <p>If the option <m>-escapeTab</m> is given then the character
        '\t' will be escaped as character reference in attribute
        values and text content of elements. The default is to not do
        this.</p>

      </commanddef>

      <commanddef>
        <command><method>asCanonicalXML</method> <option>?-channel channelId?</option> <option>?-comments &lt;boolean&gt;?</option></command>
        <desc><p>Returns the DOM tree as canonical XML string
        according to the "<ref
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315">Canonical
        XML Version 1.0 W3C Recommendation 15 March 2001</ref>" or
        sends the output directly to the given channelId.</p>

        <p>If the goal is to get a canonical XML serialization of the
        XML file from which the DOM tree was parsed there are a few
        prerequisites. The XML data must be parsed with the
        <m>-keepEmpties</m> option. If the XML data includes a DTD
        which defines attribute defaults or external parsed entity
        references it is necessary to use the expat parser (not the
        <m>-simple</m> one). For any supported Tcl version lesser then
        9.0 if the XML data includes characters outside the BMP a Tcl
        build with TCL_UTF_MAX defined to 6 (and a tDOM build with
        this Tcl) is necessary.
        </p>

        <p>If the -channel option is given then the output is send
        directly to the Tcl channel given as argument. It is the up to
        the caller to ensure that the channel is correctly
        fconfigured. If this option is not given then the command
        returns the serialization as string.</p>
        
        <p>If the option <m>-comments</m> is given with a true value
        then the serialization includes comments according to the
        rules of the recommendation. If the value is false or this
        option is omitted then comments are removed from the
        serialization.</p>

      <commanddef>
        <command><method>asHTML</method> <option>?-channel
channelId?</option> <option>?-escapeNonASCII?</option> <option>?-htmlEntities?</option> <option>?-doctypeDeclaration &lt;boolean&gt;?</option> <option>?-breakLines?</option> <option>?-onlyContents?</option></command> 
        <desc><p>Returns the DOM tree serialized according to HTML rules
        (HTML elements are recognized regardless of case, without end
        tags for empty HTML elements etc.) as string or sends the
        output directly to the given channelId.</p>

        <p>If the option <m>-escapeNonASCII</m> is given, every non 7
        bit ASCII character in attribute values or element PCDATA
        content will be escaped as character reference in decimal
        representation.</p>
        
        <p>If the option <m>-htmlEntities</m> is given, a character or
        a pair of characters is written using its HTML 5 character
        entity reference, if it has one. Some HTML 5 character entity
        references encode the same character or code points. From the
        possible entity names the shortest is choosen. If there are
        more than one shortest name and this names differ only in case
        then the lowercase alternative is choosen. Otherwise frist
        name in lexical ASCII order is choosen. There is one HTML5
        entitiy (ThickSpace), which escapes two characters for which
        the first and the second character have an entity name by
        itself. If the two characters are to be serialized then the
        one two-characters entity ThickSpace will be choosen.</p>

        <p>If the option <m>-breakLines</m> is given the serialization
        outputs "\n>" instead of ">" for the opening tags of
        elements.</p>

        <p>If the option <m>-onlyContents</m> is given only all child
        nodes are serialized. This option is ignored by document
        nodes.</p>
        
        <p>If the flag <m>-doctypeDeclaration</m> is given there will
        be a DOCTYPE declaration emitted before the first node of the
        document. The default is, to do not. The DOCTYPE name will
        always be the element name of the document element without
        case normalization. An external entity declaration of the
        external subset is only emitted, if the document has a system
        identifier. The doctype declaration will be written from the
        available information, without check, if this is a known (w3c)
        HTML version information or if the document confirms to the
        given HTML version. All nodes types other than document nodes
        ignore this option.</p></desc>
      </commanddef>

      <commanddef>
        <command><method>asText</method></command>
          <desc>The asText method returns the tree by serializing the
          string-value of every text node in document order without
          any escaping. In effect, this is what the xslt output method
          "text" (XSLT 1.0 recommendation, section 16.3) does.</desc>
      </commanddef>

      <commanddef>
        <command><method>asJSON</method> <option>?-indent none/0..8?</option> <option>?-channel channelId?</option></command>
          <desc><p>The asJSON method serializes the tree into a valid
          JSON data string. In general, this may be a lossy
          serialization. For this serialization all comment, character
          data sections and processing instruction nodes, all
          attributes and all XML namespaces are ignored. Only element
          and text nodes may be reflected in the generated JSON
          serialization. Appropriate JSON data type information of a
          node will be respected.</p>

          <p>If an element node has the JSON type OBJECT, then every
          element node child of this element will be serialized as
          member of that object, with the node name of the child as
          the member name and the relevant children of that child as
          the value. Every other child nodes will be ignored.</p>

          <p>If an element node has the JSON type ARRAY, then the text
          and element node children of that element node are serialized
          as the consecutive values of the array. Element node children
          of an ARRAY element will be container nodes for nested ARRAY
          or OBJECT values.</p>

          <p>Text nodes with the JSON types TRUE, FALSE or NULL will
          be serialized to the corresponding JSON token without
          looking at the value of the text node. A text node without
          JSON type will always be serialized as a JSON string token.
          A text node with JSON type NUMBER will be serialized as JSON
          number token if the text node value is in fact a valid JSON
          number and as a JSON string if not.</p>

          <p>If an element node doesn't has a JSON type then the
          serialization of its children is determined by the following
          rules:</p>

          <p>Only text and element node child are relevant. If the
          element node to serialize is the member of a JSON object and
          there is no relevant child node the value of that member
          will be an empty JSON string. If the only relevant child
          node of this element node is a text node then the JSON
          value of that text node will be the value of the object
          member. If the element has more than one relevant child
          nodes and the first one is a text node then the relevant
          children will be serialized as JSON array. If the only
          relevant child node is an element node or the first relevant
          child is an element node and the node name of that only or
          first relevant child isn't equal to the array container node
          name all element node children will be serialized as the
          members of a JSON object (while ignoring any intermixed text
          nodes). If the only or first relevant child is an element
          node and the node name of this child is equal to the array
          container element name then all relevant children will be
          serialized as the values of a JSON array.</p>

          <p>If the element to serialize is a value of a JSON array
          and the node name of this element isn't equal to the array
          container node name that element will be seen as a container
          node for a JSON object and all element node children will be
          serialized as the members of that array while ignoring any
          text node children. If the element to serialize is a value of
          a JSON array and the node name of this element is equal to
          the array container node name, all relevant children will be
          serialized as JSON array.</p>

          <p>If the <m>-channel</m> option is given the serialization
          isn't returned as string but send directly to the channel,
          given as argument to the option.</p>

          <p>If the <m>-indent</m> option is given and the argument
          given to this option isn't "none" then the returned JSON
          string is "pretty-printed". The numeric argument to this
          option defines the number of spaces for any indentation
          level. The default is to not emit any additional
          white space.</p></desc>

      <commanddef>
        <command><method>publicId</method> <m>?publicId?</m></command>
        <desc>Returns the public identifier of the doctype declaration of the
document, if there is one, otherwise the empty string. If there is a value
given to the method, the public identifier of the document is set to this
value.</desc>

        <command><method>internalSubset</method> <m>?internalSubset?</m></command>
        <desc>Returns the internal subset of the doctype declaration of the
document, if there is one, otherwise the empty string. If there is a value
given to the method, the internal subset of the document is set to this
value. Note that none of the parsing methods preserve the internal subset
of a document; a freshly parsed document will always have an empty internal
subset. Also note that the method doesn't do any syntactical check on a
given internal subset.</desc>

      <commanddef>
        <command><method>cdataSectionElements</method> <m>(?URI:?localname|*) ?&lt;boolean&gt;?</m></command>
        <desc>This method allows one to control for which element nodes
the text node children will be serialized as CDATA sections (this affects only
serialization with the asXML method, no text node is altered in any
way by this method). IF the method is called with an element name as
first argument and a boolean with value true as second argument, every
text node child of every element node in the document with the same
name as the first argument will be serialized as CDATA section. If the
second argument is a boolean with value false, all text nodes of all
elements with the same name as the first argument will be serialized
as usual. Namespaced element names have to be given in the form
namespace_URI:localname, not in the otherwise usual prefix:localname
form. With two arguments called, the method returns the used boolean
value. If the method is called with only an element name, it will
return a boolean value, indicating that the text node children of all
elements with that name in the document will be serialized as CDATA
section elements (return value 1) or not (return value 0). If the
method is called with only one argument and that argument is an
asterisk ('*'), then the method returns an unordered list of all
element names of the document, for which the text node children will be
serialized as CDATA section nodes.</desc>

      <commanddef>
        <command><method>selectNodesNamespaces</method> <option>?prefixUriList?</option></command>
        <desc>This method gives control to a document global prefix to
        namespace URI mapping, which will be used for selectNodes
        method calls (on document as well as on all nodes, which
        belongs to the document) if it is not overwritten by using the
        -namespaces option of the selectNodes method. Any namespace
        prefix within an xpath expression will be first resolved
        against this list. If the list binds the same prefix to
        different namespaces, then the first binding will win. If a
        prefix could not resolved against the document global prefix /
        namespaces list, then the namespace definitions in scope of
        the context node will be used to resolve the prefix, as usual.
        If the optional argument <m>prefixUriList</m> is given, then
        the global prefix / namespace list is set to this list and
        returns it. Without the optional argument the method returns
        the current list. The default is the empty list.</desc>

      <commanddef>
        <command><method>xslt</method> <option>?-parameters
parameterList?</option> <option>?-ignoreUndeclaredParameters?</option>
<option>?-maxApplyDepth int?</option>
<option>?-xsltmessagecmd script?</option> <m>stylesheet</m> <m>?outputVar?</m></command>
        <desc>Applies an XSLT transformation on the whole document of the node
object using the XSLT <m>stylesheet</m> (given as domDoc). Returns a document
object containing the result document of the transformation and stores that
document object in the optional <m>outputVar</m>, if that was given.

<p>The optional <m>-parameters</m> option sets top level
&lt;xsl:param&gt; to string values. The <m>parameterList</m> has to be a tcl
list consisting of parameter name and value pairs.</p>

<p>If the option <m>-ignoreUndeclaredParameters</m> is given, then parameter
names in the <m>parameterList</m> given to the <m>-parameters</m> options that
are not declared as top-level parameters in the stylesheet are silently
ignored. Without this option, an error is raised if the user tries to set a
top-level parameter that is not declared in the stylesheet.</p>

<p>The option <m>-maxApplyDepth</m> expects a positiv integer as
argument. By default, the XSLT engine allows XSLT templates to nest up
to 3000 levels (and raises error if they nest deeper). This limit can
be set by the <m>-maxApplyDepth</m> option.</p>

<p>The <m>-xsltmessagecmd</m> option sets a callback for xslt:message elements
in the stylesheet. The actual command consists of the script, given as argument
to the option, appended with the XML Fragment from instantiating the
xsl:message element content as string (as if the XPath string() function would
have been applied to the XML Fragment) and a flag, which indicates, if the
xsl:message has an attribute "terminate" with the value "yes". If the
called script returns anything else then TCL_OK then the XSLT
transformation will be aborted, returning error. If the called script
returns -code break, the error message is empty, otherwise the result
code is reported. In case of terminated transformation, the outputVar,
if given, is set to the empty string.</p>

      <commanddef>
        <command><method>toXSLTcmd</method> ?<m>objVar</m>?</command>
     
        <desc>If the DOM tree represents a valid XSLT stylesheet, this method
transforms the DOM tree into an XSLT command, otherwise it returns error. The
created xsltCmd is returned and stored in the <m>objVar</m>, if a var name was
given. A successful transformation of the DOM tree to an xsltCmd removes the
domDoc cmd and all nodeCmds of the document. 

<p>The syntax of the created xsltCmd is:</p>
 
<syntax>
<cmd>xsltCmd</cmd> <option>method</option> <option>?arg ...?</option>
</syntax>

<p>The valid methods are:</p>

<commandlist>
  <commanddef>
    <command><method>transform</method> <option>?-parameters
parameterList?</option> <option>?-ignoreUndeclaredParameters?</option>
<option>?-maxApplyDepth int?</option> 
<option>?-xsltmessagecmd script?</option> <m>domDoc</m> <m>?outputVar?</m></command>          

        <desc>Applies XSLT transformation on the document
<m>domDoc</m>. Returns a document object containing the
result document of that transformation and stores it in the optional
<m>outputVar</m>. 

<p>The optional <m>-parameters</m> option sets top level
&lt;xsl:param&gt; to string values. The <m>parameterList</m> has to be a tcl
list consisting of parameter name and value pairs.</p>

<p>If the option <m>-ignoreUndeclaredParameters</m> is given, then parameter
names in the <m>parameterList</m> given to the <m>-parameters</m> options that
are not declared as top-level parameters in the stylesheet are silently
ignored. Without this option, an error is raised if the user tries to set a
top-level parameter, which is not declared in the stylesheet.</p>

<p>The option <m>-maxApplyDepth</m> expects a positiv integer as
argument. By default, the XSLT engine allows XSLT templates to nest up
to 3000 levels (and raises error if they nest deeper). This limit can
be set by the <m>-maxApplyDepth</m> option.</p>

<p>The <m>-xsltmessagecmd</m> option sets a callback for xslt:message elements
in the stylesheet. The actual command consists of the script, given as argument
to the option, appended with the XML Fragment from instantiating the
xsl:message element content as string (as if the XPath string() function would
have been applied to the XML Fragment) and a flag, which indicates, if the
xsl:message has an attribute "terminate" with the value "yes".</p>

    <command><method>delete</method></command>          
    <desc>Deletes the xsltCmd and cleans up all used recourses</desc>
  </commanddef>

<p>If the first argument to an xsltCmd is a domDoc or starts with a "-",
then the command is processed in the same way as 
<m>&lt;xsltCmd&gt; transform</m>.</p>
